# Security track topics

## Reduced

1.	Cyber and cyber-physical security
2.  Identity and trust management
3.	Anonymity, authentication, access control
4.  Intrusion and anomaly detection
5.  Cloud and data security
6. 	Security usability 
7.	Cryptography and protocol security
8.	Security heuristics and metrics
9.  Policies, contracts and SLAs
10.	Mobile security, privacy and permissions

If this has to be cut down to 8, I suggested removing 9 and 10.
