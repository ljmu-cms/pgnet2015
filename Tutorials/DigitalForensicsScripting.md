# PGNet 2015 - Tutorial Session

## Title
Python Scripting for Digital Forensics

## What's it about?

This session will be an expansion of the short Python scripting given to LEAs as part of the PGNet 2014 ECENTRE
training workshop.  Topics covered will include:

* Introduction to computer programming with scripting languages.
* Introduction to the Python language and interpreter.
* The role of scripting within the digital forensic toolchain.

These introductory topics will be addressed through a short, non-interactive talk.  Following from this, the
session will then move to the development of a practical Python program that addresses a real-world digital
forensic need, covering:

* Problem decomposition and basic program design.
* Constructing scripts.
* Input and output.
* Extracting forensically relevant information.
* Interpreting and analysing this information.
* Generating reports.

The problem this program solves will be determined closer to the time of the workshop based on feedback from
police forces that agree to attend.

## Schedule

The session will run on Monday morning; approximately three or four hours will be sufficient to deliver the
material.

## Equipment

Each student will need a computer to work on.  These computers will require at least a Python 3.4+ interpreter and
supporting modules that will be determined when the problem being solved is agreed with attendees.

## Who's involved?

* Brett Lempereur
